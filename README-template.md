## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) - For weather data fetching




### What I learned

- How to use the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data based on user location
- Debouncing user input to optimize API requests and improve performance --- IGNORE ---
- Managing state in React for dynamic data rendering
- Implementing responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS
- Handling asynchronous operations and loading states in a React application
- Creating reusable components for better code organization and maintainability
- Integrating third-party APIs into a React application


### Continued development

- I want to further improve my skills in API integration and data handling in React applications.
- I plan to explore more advanced state management techniques in React, such as using Context API or Redux.
- I aim to enhance my understanding of responsive design and accessibility best practices to create more inclusive web applications.
- I would like to experiment with additional features, such as user authentication or personalized settings, to make the app more user-centric.
- I want to deepen my knowledge of Tailwind CSS to create more complex and visually appealing designs efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation is a great place to learn about the library's features and best practices.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official Tailwind CSS documentation provides comprehensive guides and examples for using the utility-first CSS framework.
- [Open-Meteo API Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) - The API documentation for Open-Meteo, which I used to fetch weather data for the application.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A valuable resource for web developers, offering in-depth articles and tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
